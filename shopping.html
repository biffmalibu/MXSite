					<h1>Newbury Street</h1>
					<p>Newbury Street is a charming, mile-long thoroughfare that runs east of Massachusetts Avenue in Boston. It's a well-known destination for both locals and tourists, lined with hundreds of shops and restaurants housed within historic 19th-century brownstones. The most upscale boutiques are clustered near the Boston Public Garden end of the street. However, as you head towards Mass Ave, the shops become slightly less expensive and more bohemian. To the west of Mass Ave, Newbury Street is adjacent to the Mass Pike on its unbuilt southern side, while the northern side mostly comprises parking and rear service areas for buildings on Commonwealth Avenue. The street is briefly interrupted by the Muddy River before continuing its path to abut the Pike until it reaches Brookline Avenue. There's currently a proposed plan to deck over the Pike to the west of Mass Ave, which could pave the way for an expansion of the shopping district.</p>
